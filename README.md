 * An admin dashboard,
 * Autogenerated RESTish APIs,
 * Custom events and extensible routes.

## How to Use
Before starting, check if you meet the requirements [here](https://github.com/pinniped-baas).

Install the dependency
```javascript 
npm install pinniped
```
Import and create a Pinniped instance
```javascript
// CommonJS
const { pnpd } = require('pinniped');
const app = pnpd();
app.start(serverConfig);

// Or ECMAScript
import { pnpd } from 'pinniped'
const app = pnpd();
app.start(serverConfig);
```
Or install the CLI and create a project
1. Run `npm install pinniped-cli -g`
2. Run `pinniped create`

## Documentation

## Server Config
If your Pinniped project was built with `pinniped-cli`, then the project's `.env` file will contain supported configuration settings.

### start (serverConfig)
The Pinniped instance accepts an object that contains the server configuration.
There are configurations to change how the Express server runs. By default, these values are expected to be in a `.env` file. 
However, you can change the source for the server-specific configurations by passing in your own object when `start` is invoked.
```javascript
let serverConfig = {
  port: process.env.SERVER_PORT,
  domain: process.env.SERVER_DOMAIN,
  altNames: process.env.SERVER_ALTNAMES,
  directory: process.env.SERVER_DIRECTORY,
};

app.start(serverConfig);
```

### SERVER_DOMAIN 
The base domain name for requesting a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt. If `SERVER_DOMAIN` has a value, it will attempt to auto-cert the domain.
If this is undefined the server will run on `SERVER_PORT`. If `SERVER_DOMAIN` is present and the auto-cert runs, the `SERVER_PORT` value is ignored and the server will run on port 443 with a redirect server (running on port 80) that points to port 443. 
```javascript
SERVER_DOMAIN=example.com
```

### SERVER_ALTNAMES
Holds any alternative names you'd like on the certificate. If left undefined, it'll automatically add the `www` version of `SERVER_DOMAIN`. If you have multiple domain names that point to the same site you can add them here. The format is the same as `SERVER_DOMAIN` but commas separate each name. 
```javascript
SERVER_ALTNAMES=www.example.com,www.example.net
```

### SERVER_DIRECTORY 
This specifies whether to try to obtain a staging certificate or a production certificate from Let's Encrypt. By default, it will get a staging certificate. Once you verify that you can get the staging certificate you can change this value to `production`. 
```javascript
SERVER_DIRECTORY=production
```
For more information about this process, check out [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/).

### SERVER_PORT
The port that the server runs on. This is only used if `SERVER_DOMAIN` is undefined and the server is running on HTTP. It defaults to 3000 if undefined.

### CORS_WHITELIST 
Can be regex or plaintext, if not provided, defaults to allowing all CORS traffic. Commas separate each domain that CORS should allow. 
```javascript
CORS_WHITELIST=www.example.com,/regexvalue/,www.example2.com
```

### SESSION_SECRET 
Used by the server to encrypt session information. If left blank the server will automatically generate one and save it here.

## Custom Routes and Event Handlers
To extend Pinniped's base functionality, you can add custom routes or use Pinniped's custom events to add an event listener and run a callback. This extension code is added to the `pinniped` app instance before `app.start()` is called.
```javascript
import { pnpd } from 'pinniped'
const app = pnpd();

app.addRoute("GET", "/store", () => {
  console.log("GET request received at /store");
});

app.start(serverConfig);
```

### addRoute (method, path, handler)
`addRoute` mounts the parameter, path, onto the host's path. Once it receives
the specified HTTP request method at that path, it'll invoke the handler passed in.
```javascript
app.addRoute("GET", "/store", () => {
  console.log("GET request received at /store");
});

// The route can accept parameters
app.addRoute("GET", "/custom/:msg", (c) => {
  const msg = c.pathParam('msg');
  return c.json(200, { message: `My custom endpoint ${msg}` });
});
```
### addListener (handler, tables)
`addListener` takes a handler function that executes when Pinniped's custom events are triggered. 
You can specify the table(s) you'd like to listen for if the event type deals with tables.

For example:
```javascript
// Adds a listener on the event: "getOneRow".
// The handler is executed when the event, "getOneRow", is triggered on table "seals".
app.onGetOneRow.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Triggered Event: getOneRow");
}, ["seals"]);
```
You can add several tables or omit the tables to run anytime the event is triggered.
```javascript
// Adds a listener on the event: "createOneRow".
// The handler is executed when the event, "createOneRow", is triggered on any table.
app.onCreateOneRow.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Triggered Event: createOneRow");
});

// Or the handler can be executed on specific tables.
app.onCreateOneRow.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Triggered Event: createOneRow");
}, ["seals", "pinnipeds", "users"]);
```

`addListener` can work asynchronously. **Note:** The route that triggered the event will not return a http response to the client until all callbacks return. This means if you `await` something in a async callback the response will be delayed. This allows you to use the async callback to enrich the response object, use with caution.


```javascript
// Adds a listener on the event: "loginUser".
app.onLoginUser.addListener(async () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    sendUserWelcomeEmail();
  }, 5000);
});
```

Here are all the possible properties of the Pinniped instance, relating to the event type.
